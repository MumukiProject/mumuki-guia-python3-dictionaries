Now that we've added planet dictionaries, let's do a little work with them! :muscle:

> Define a function `planet_temperature` that receives a planet dictionary as argument and returns a string indicating its name and its average temperature. It has to work for any planet! :earth_americas: For example:

> ```
ムplanet_temperature(mercury)
"Mercury has an average temperature of 67 degrees"
ムplanet_temperature(saturn)
"Saturn has an average temperature of -139 degrees"
ムplanet_temperature(venus)
"Venus has an average temperature of 462 degrees"
```
