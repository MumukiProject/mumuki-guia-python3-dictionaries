If you don't remember how we initialized to the monuments, we'll show you the Eiffel Tower again:

```python
eiffel_tower = { "name": "Eiffel Tower", "location": "Paris, France", "year_of_construction": 1889 }
```

When a dictionary gets a bit clumsy, you can add _newlines_ as necessary: 

```python
# equivalent to previous example
# but easier to read ðŸ˜Ž
eiffel_tower = { 
  "name": "Eiffel Tower", 
  "location": "Paris, France", 
  "year_of_construction": 1889 
}
```
