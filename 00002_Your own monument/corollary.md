Good search skills! :mag: :wink:

Dictionaries, just like lists, are a _data structure_ because they allow us to organize information. But what's the difference between a dictionary and a list? :thinking:

Within a list we can store many **ordered** elements of the **same type** that represent the same thing (for example a numbers-only list, or a strings-only list). There are no limits to lists: they can have many elements, or none at all!

On the other hand, inside a dictionary - also known as `dict`s in Python üêç - we are going to store information related to a single thing (for example **a** monument or **a** person), but the types for each field may vary. For example, the name and location of a monument are strings, but its year of construction is a number.
