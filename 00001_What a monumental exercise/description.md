Feli is collecting information about various monuments around the world :earth_americas:. At first Feli only wanted to know the name, location and year of construction of each monument and stored each piece of information in a variable :moyai::

```python
statue_of_liberty_name = "Statue of Liberty"
statue_of_liberty_location = "New York"
statue_of_liberty_construction_year = 1886

christ_redeemer_name = "Christ the Redeemer"
christ_redeemer_location = "Rio De Janeiro"
christ_redeemer_construction_year = 1931
```

That's when Feli realized that it wasn't convenient :unamused:: although the information between the variables was linked, it was being stored separately. Isn't there some way to represent the different characteristics or properties of the same thing grouped together?

 > After some research, Feli found a better way to store the information of the monuments. You can see it by typing in the console:
>
>``` python
ムstatue_of_liberty
```
>
>``` python
ムchrist_redeemer
```
>
>``` python
ムeiffel_tower
```
>
>``` python
ムtaj_mahal
```
>
>``` python
ムcolosseum
```
